## Overview

The Accordion component provides collapsible content areas with smooth animations. Features hover-to-expand behavior with a delay and click-to-pin functionality. Only one accordion can be pinned at a time.

## Usage

```astro
---
import Accordion from "@/components/ui/Accordion.astro";
---

<Accordion>
  <span slot="trigger">Accordion Title</span>
  <p slot="content">
    Your accordion content goes here.
  </p>
</Accordion>
```

## Basic Example

Create simple accordions:

<Accordion>
  <span slot="trigger">Product Information</span>
  <div slot="content">
    <p>Our flagship product combines cutting-edge technology...</p>
  </div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion>
  <span slot="trigger">Shipping Details</span>
  <div slot="content">
    <p>We offer worldwide shipping through trusted partners...</p>
  </div>
</Accordion>

```astro
<Accordion>
  <span slot="trigger">Product Information</span>
  <div slot="content">
    <p>Our flagship product combines cutting-edge technology...</p>
  </div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion>
  <span slot="trigger">Shipping Details</span>
  <div slot="content">
    <p>We offer worldwide shipping through trusted partners...</p>
  </div>
</Accordion>
```

## Default Open

Start with an accordion expanded:

<Accordion open>
  <span slot="trigger">Is it accessible?</span>
  <p slot="content">
    Yes. It uses hover-to-expand and click-to-pin interactions
    with smooth animations and proper accessibility support.
  </p>
</Accordion>

```astro
<Accordion open>
  <span slot="trigger">Is it accessible?</span>
  <p slot="content">
    Yes. It uses hover-to-expand and click-to-pin interactions
    with smooth animations and proper accessibility support.
  </p>
</Accordion>
```

## Custom Icon

Use a different icon:

<Accordion icon="plus">
  <span slot="trigger">With Plus Icon</span>
  <p slot="content">
    The icon automatically rotates when the accordion expands.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="github">
  <span slot="trigger">With Chevron Right</span>
  <p slot="content">
    Any icon from your collection can be used.
  </p>
</Accordion>

```astro
<Accordion icon="plus">
  <span slot="trigger">With Plus Icon</span>
  <p slot="content">
    The icon automatically rotates when the accordion expands.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="github">
  <span slot="trigger">With Chevron Right</span>
  <p slot="content">
    Any icon from your collection can be used.
  </p>
</Accordion>
```

## Interaction Behavior

The accordion has three states:

1. **Collapsed** (default): Content is hidden
2. **Hover**: Expands after hovering for 180ms, collapses when mouse leaves
3. **Pinned**: Remains expanded until clicked again or another accordion is pinned

### Interaction Rules

- **Hover on header**: Expands after 180ms delay
- **Leave header**: Collapses if not pinned
- **Click header**: Toggles between pinned and collapsed
- **Click outside**: Unpins currently pinned accordion
- **Pin another**: Automatically unpins the previous one

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `open` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether accordion starts pinned (open) |
| `icon` | `string` | `"caret-up"` | Icon name from your collection |
| `class` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes |

## Slots

| Slot | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `trigger` | Header content users click or hover over |
| `content` | Collapsible content that expands/collapses |

## Accessibility

- Use semantic heading elements in the `trigger` slot when appropriate
- Maintains focus states during interactions
- Icon rotation provides visual feedback
- Keyboard navigation works with standard click events

## Notes

- Requires the `astro-icon` package
- Uses client-side JavaScript for interactions
- Only one accordion pinned at a time across all accordions on page
- 180ms hover delay prevents accidental expansions
