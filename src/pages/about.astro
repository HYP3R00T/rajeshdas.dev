        <Accordion>
          <span slot="header">What is Astro?</span>
          <span slot="content">
            Astro is a modern static site builder that lets you build faster
            websites with less client-side JavaScript. It supports multiple
            frameworks and is perfect for content-driven sites.

        <Accordion>
          <span slot="header">How does the accordion work?</span>
          <span slot="content">
            This accordion component uses vanilla JavaScript to manage state.
            When you click a header, it opens that item and closes all others.
            The animation is handled with CSS transitions.
          </span>
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion>
          <span slot="header">Can I customize the styling?</span>
          <span slot="content">
            Yes! The component uses CSS custom properties (variables) that
            reference Tailwind CSS color tokens. You can easily modify the
            styles in the component file.
          </span>
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion>
          <span slot="header">Is this accessible?</span>
          <span slot="content">
            The component uses semantic HTML with button elements for headers.
            You can enhance it further by adding ARIA attributes like
            aria-expanded and aria-controls for better screen reader support.
